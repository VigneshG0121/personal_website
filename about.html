      <h2>Vignesh Kumar Gopalakrishnan</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Interdisciplinary Dual Degree student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, pursuing a B.Tech in Engineering Design 
        and M.Tech in Computational Engineering from the School of Interdisciplinary Studies. Although I could refer to certain broad domains as my research interests,
        I am constantly discovering new topics that excite me, which increasingly revolve around mechanics and soft biological matter, ranging from computational modeling frameworks for viscoelasticity or collective cell dynamics, to soft robotics.

        Driven by my passion for motorsports and Formula One, my undergrad journey began with joining <a href="https://www.raftariitm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raftar Formula Racing</a>, the Formula Student team of IITM, as a Chassis Engineer.
         I would go on to spend the next year and a half working on the Frame and Composites, where I developed a strong interest in the mechanics of heterogeneous materials and the computational tools employed to study them.  
      </p>
      <p>
      My research journey began with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YrdfmsQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Srikanth Vedantam</a> (Medical Sciences and Technology, IITM), working on a physics-based model for theoretical fatigue life prediction for rotating bending fatigue life using a recently 
      developed Microelement Plastic Strain Accumulation model. What started as an exploratory attempt soon made significant progress with promising results emerging. Our paper was accepted at <a href="https://event.asme.org/IMECE-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMECE 2024</a>, ASME's Annual National Congress at Portland, Oregon,
      which marked my first conference, oral presentation and conference publication.

      While I originally intended to pursue research on Composite Structures based on my previous experience, a subtle nudge by <a href=" https://home.iitm.ac.in/aarajan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Arockiarajan A</a> (Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engg, IITM) to explore
      the mechanics of biomaterials set in motion cascading events which led to my work on the application of Fractal Calculus for rheological modeling of Soft Biological Matter. But things didn't stop there.
      Mechanobiology frequently emerged in discussions on the mechanics of biological matter and it got me curious. Fast forward a few months, I found myself heading to the <a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mechanobiology Institute</a> at the National University of Singapore
       as a Summer Intern in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hirashima-group/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collective Cell Dynamics Laboratory</a>  under  <a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/tsuyoshi-hirashima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Tsuyoshi Hirashima</a> .

      My short stint at the Mechanobiology Institute was my first experience at a primarily wet lab based research space. From learning about a range of microscopy techniques to shadowing
       other lab members performing a wide variety of experiments, it was a truly fascinating experience where I spent a majority of days awestruck by the amazing experimental capabilities
       available to researchers, which was being complemented by theoretical and computational work. It was also the first time I felt I was working with a thoroughly interdisciplinary team, which allowed for a unique exchange of knowledge across different domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently back at IITM for my Masters Thesis, continuing my research on Fractal Viscoplasticity for Soft Biological Matter under <a href=" https://home.iitm.ac.in/aarajan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Arockiarajan A</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OdSekHAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Shuvrangsu Das</a>. 
        With my first journal publication recently published in Materials & Design, exploring fractal calculus based rheological modeling frameworks, we are more excited than ever for the next big step!
