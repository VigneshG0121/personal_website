      <h2>Fractal Constitutive Modeling of Soft Biological Matter</h2>
      <h3>Masters Thesis</h3>
      <h5>Guides: Prof. Arockiarajan A & Prof. Shuvrangsu Das | Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering | IIT Madras</h5>
      <p>
        Having established a strong foundation for the application of fractal calculus in rheological modeling of soft biological matter using fractal frameworks, 
        we are currently developing fractal calculus-based unified constitutive modeling frameworks. Tensor formulations would enable the incorporation of fluidity into finite element solvers, aiming for major advances in unified elasto-visco-plastic simulation of soft biological matter.

      <h2>Fractal Rheology-informed Neural Networks</a></h2>
      <p>
        Rheology-informed Neural Networks are expected to bring a breakthrough in rapid and precise description of complex rheological behavior, which when combined with the generality of fractal calculus could 
        lead to interesting discoveries

        <h5>Guide: Prof. Arockiarajan A | Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering | IIT Madras</h5>
        <p>
          This project aimed to establish fractal calculus as a powerful tool for rheological modeling of soft biological matter, largely attributed to its mathematical simplicity
          and ability to capture the spectrum of behavior between classical solid and fluid rheological models. From potential cancer biomechanical markers to capturing tissue fluidity,
          the future for fractal frameworks looks highly promising. More details inside!

        <h2>MPSA Model for Fatigue Life Prediction</h2>
        <h5>Guide: Prof. Srikanth Vedantam | Medical Science and Technology | IIT Madras</h5>
        <p>
          The Microelement Plastic Strain Accumulation (MPSA) Model is a theoretical discrete element formulation based on the Jenkin-Masing model for fatigue life prediction. Its uniqueness lies in its ability to capture
          the observed band of scatter in experimental fatigue results arising due to spatial distibution of material heterogenites.
